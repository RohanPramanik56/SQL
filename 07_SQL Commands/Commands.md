# Commands in SQL
In SQL, commands are categorized into different types based on their functionality. These categories help in organizing and understanding the various operations you can perform on a database.

- **Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands**
- **Data Query Language (DQL) Commands**
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands**
- **Data Control Language (DCL) Commands**
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL) Commands**

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands
DDL commands define the structure of the database. These commands are responsible for creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables. 
- **Create:** Helps in creating a new table or other database objects.
- **Alter:** Modifies an existing database object.
- **Drop:** Deletes an existing database object.
- **Truncate:** Removes all records from a table, but the table structure remains.

### 2. Data Query Language (DQL) Commands
DQL commands are used to query the database and retrieve data. 
- **Select:** Used to select data from a database.

### 3. Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands
DML commands manipulate the data stored in the database. These commands are frequently used to insert, update, and delete data.
- **Insert:** Used to insert new records into a table.
- **Update:** Used to update existing records in a table.
- **Delete:** Used to delete existing records from a table.

### 4. Data Control Language (DCL) Commands
DCL commands control access to the data in the database. These commands are crucial for database security and management.
- **Grant:** Used to give users access privileges to the database.
- **Revoke:** Used to remove access privileges from users.

### 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL) Commands
TCL commands manage the changes made by DML statements. These commands ensure the integrity of the database by allowing control over transactions. 
- **Commit:** Used to save all changes made in the current transaction.
- **Rollback:** Used to undo changes made in the current transaction.
- **Savepoint:** Used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
